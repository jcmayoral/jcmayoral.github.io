Here, you will find the bibliography of a Mexican Engineer passionate about Robotics, Automation, and Education. I believe that technology has the potential to make the world a better place for us and our beloved ones.

In 2013, I finished my Undergraduate Studies at La Salle University in my hometown, Mexico City. Later, in 2018 my Master's Studies at the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg in Germany ended up.

In 2019, I started my Ph.D. studies at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences in the context of the GrassRobotics project that aims for safe agricultural task automation.
